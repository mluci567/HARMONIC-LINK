# HARMONIC-LINK
Given two input artists, HARMONIC LINK finds the shortest "harmonic path" between them. This path seamlessly blends direct musical connections (collaborations, features, samples) and genre-bridging artists. The final output is both an interactive visual graph of the journey and a playable Spotify playlist of the linking tracks.
